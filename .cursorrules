# Cursor Rules for Collab Canvas Project

## Testing
- When running tests, ALWAYS use `npx vitest run` instead of `npm test`
- Reason: `npm test` enters watch mode and hangs, requiring manual cancellation
- For running tests with specific options, use `npx vitest run` with appropriate flags

## Git History
- NEVER rewrite git history (no force push, no rebase on shared branches, no --amend on pushed commits)
- Keep commit history clean and intact for collaboration and debugging
- Use `git revert` instead of rewriting history to undo changes
