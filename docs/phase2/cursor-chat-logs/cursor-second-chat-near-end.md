Supplementary chat for building out the AI btx as outlined in docs/phase2/ You don't need to read all of those documents, just crock the very beginning of them. In this chat, I'll just dump everything that comes to mind as an experiment to see if you can help augment my working memory. Okay, so the main thing is comprehensive manual testing for the AI bots, which I'm sure will surface bugs, I'm thinking about doing that in separate PR. Okay, make that one bullet point, and now make this another bullet point. Tell the other chat to do code cleanup. And now another bullet point. I could make a demo video at the end of all of my work for my portfolio. Another bullet point, I need to review the MVP feedback, in fact, I'll give that to you and you can create tasks from it. Oh, and another bullet point, I need you to read the rubric carefully and identify highest value ROI work for additional rubric points. Okay, can you make a list of those bullet points?

I'll create a clear list of those bullet points for you:

## AI Feature Work - Next Steps

1. **Comprehensive manual testing for AI bots** - Will likely surface bugs; consider doing this in a separate PR

2. **Tell the other chat to do code cleanup**

3. **Make a demo video** - Create at the end of all work for portfolio

4. **Review MVP feedback** - You'll provide feedback and I'll create actionable tasks from it

5. **Review rubric for high-ROI work** - Carefully read the rubric and identify highest value opportunities for additional points

---

Ready when you are! Feel free to:
- Share the MVP feedback whenever you're ready and I'll break it down into tasks
- Point me to the rubric document so I can analyze it for high-value opportunities
- Continue brain-dumping any other thoughts that come to mind

Okay, here's the MVP feedback I received. Please create concise bullet point tasks (I can expand the descriptions later, I just want high-level for now): "[Ash's review] Hey Adam, you've passed MVP. You still have to add auth. [My note: I currently use Firebase Anonymous Auth] Just use a third party like Auth0 or Firebase. The next thing is when you've clicked on a rectangle and that's the rectangle that's selected, if I go to move another rectangle, then I'm unable to move that. It should automatically just change the rectangle that's selected, not wait for me to then click on that new rectangle and then try to move it. I think that'd be a better user interaction. That also leads to some lag and random bug issues. [Adam's note: I don't know what he means by lag or random bug issues.] I would improve up the UI a bit, especially the left side with all the writing that's in a really hard to read format. Get that all cohesive and then make sure that the format of the layout matches what you're trying to do for your target user."

Here are the concise tasks from the MVP feedback:

## MVP Feedback - Action Items

1. **Implement proper authentication** - Move from Firebase Anonymous Auth to full Firebase Auth (or Auth0)

2. **Fix rectangle selection UX** - Auto-select rectangle when user attempts to move it, don't require explicit click first

3. **Investigate lag/bug issues** - Note: Reviewer mentioned "lag and random bug issues" but unclear what specifically (needs clarification/testing)

4. **Improve left sidebar UI** - Text content is currently hard to read format

5. **Make layout cohesive** - Ensure overall format matches target user needs

---

These are now ready for you to expand later. Want me to add these to your working list above, or keep them separate? Also ready to look at that rubric when you want to share it!

Great, okay, I've implemented number two on MVP feedback action items, and number three does not represent an action item since I don't have enough information, and it's probably fixed since I fixed two. Can you make an updated list that's more concise and indicates two and three as completed?

## MVP Feedback - Action Items

1. **Implement proper authentication** - Move from Anonymous Auth to full Firebase Auth

2. ~~**Fix rectangle selection UX** - Auto-select on move attempt~~ âœ“

3. ~~**Investigate lag/bug issues** - Likely resolved with #2~~ âœ“

4. **Improve left sidebar UI** - Make text content easier to read

5. **Make layout cohesive** - Match format to target user needs

Likewise, can you take the earlier list of AI feature work next steps, indicate that two is done, four is in progress, five is in progress, and make it slightly more concise.

**Cursor**

## AI Feature Work - Next Steps

1. **Comprehensive manual testing** - Surface bugs; separate PR

2. ~~**Code cleanup in other chat**~~ âœ“

3. **Demo video** - Create for portfolio at end

4. **Review MVP feedback** - ðŸ”„ In progress

5. **Analyze rubric for high-ROI work** - ðŸ”„ In progress

A functionality I want to add in my next branch is users should be able to manually enter position (and it should respect the bounds).

**Cursor**

Got it! Adding that to track:

## AI Feature Work - Next Steps

1. **Comprehensive manual testing** - Surface bugs; separate PR

2. ~~**Code cleanup in other chat**~~ âœ“

3. **Demo video** - Create for portfolio at end

4. **Review MVP feedback** - ðŸ”„ In progress

5. **Analyze rubric for high-ROI work** - ðŸ”„ In progress

6. **Manual position entry** - Allow users to manually enter position; respect bounds

I also want to add functionality to enhance exact length and width. Right now, I don't think the AI commands are respecting the exact length and width requested. And along with that, I want the user to be able to inspect length and width for any selected rectangle in an unobtrusive way. Andâ€”stretch goalâ€”will be able to manually set it.

8. **Display rectangle dimensions** - Show length/width for selected rectangle (unobtrusive)

9. **Manual dimension setting** - (Stretch) Allow users to manually set length/width
