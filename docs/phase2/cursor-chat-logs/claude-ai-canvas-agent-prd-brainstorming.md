# AI Canvas Agent PRD Brainstorming

**Conversation Date:** October 18, 2025

## Human:

Good morning, Claude. This chat will be for brainstorming and coming up with a PRD for a specific part of a coding project. I will upload the PDF outlining the whole coding project, but you don't need to read the whole thing. You only need to scroll to the AI Canvas Agent heading, and then read the first two subsections, namely the AI feature, and required capabilities. And then in the third subsection, technical implementation, read the first couple of paragraphs, including the typescript sample, and then the next two subsections, called it Shared AI State and AI Agent Performance Targets. You don't need to read anything else in this PDF. Once you do that, let me know if you have any questions.

## Claude:

Good morning! I've read through the AI Canvas Agent section as you specified. I understand the core requirements:

### The AI Feature:
- Build an AI agent that manipulates the canvas through natural language using function calling
- Commands like "Create a blue rectangle in the center" should call canvas API functions
- Results appear on everyone's canvas via real-time sync

### Required Capabilities:
- Support 6+ distinct commands across creation, manipulation, layout, and complex operations
- Examples range from simple shape creation to complex multi-component layouts like login forms

### Technical Implementation:
- Define tool schema with functions like `createShape()`, `moveShape()`, `resizeShape()`, etc.
- Use OpenAI function calling or LangChain tools
- Complex operations should plan steps upfront and execute sequentially
- `getCanvasState()` for context

### Shared AI State:
- All users see the same AI-generated results
- Multiple users can use AI simultaneously without conflict

### Performance Targets:
- <2 seconds for single-step commands
- 6+ command types
- Multi-step operation execution
- Consistent accuracy
- Natural interaction with immediate feedback

I'm ready to help brainstorm! What specific aspect of the AI Canvas Agent would you like to focus on for the PRD?

## Human:

Okay, so I'm actually going to tackle this MVP style with very stripped down functionality. Your example command, create a blue rectangle in the center, that one should stay. The Required capabilities section? Let's get rid of that for now. In performance targets, say just three plus command types for MVP and take out the multi-step operation execution bullet.

Give me a revised list, calling out at the top that it's for MVP. In fact, at the top, make these notes about the existing application. Okay, so the existing app is a real-time collaborative canvas with these features: you can create rectangles by clicking, you can change their color by clicking and then picking from a color picker, you can resize it at any corner or edge, and you can move it by dragging.

# AI Canvas Agent - MVP Specification

## Existing Application Context

**Current real-time collaborative canvas features:**
- Create rectangles by clicking
- Change color via color picker
- Resize at any corner or edge
- Move by dragging

---

## AI Feature (MVP)

Build an AI agent that manipulates the canvas through natural language using function calling. When a user types a command like "Create a blue rectangle in the center," the AI calls canvas API functions and the results appear on everyone's canvas via real-time sync.

---

## Required Command Types (3+ for MVP)

1. **Create Rectangle**: "Create a blue rectangle in the center"
2. **Change Color**: "Make the rectangle red" or "Change the blue rectangle to green"
3. **Move**: "Move the rectangle to position 200, 300"

Optional additional commands to reach 3+:
- **Resize**: "Make the rectangle 150x200"
- **Delete**: "Delete the blue rectangle"

---

## Shared AI State Requirements

- All users must see the same AI-generated results
- If one user issues an AI command, everyone sees the result
- Multiple users should be able to use the AI simultaneously without conflict

---

## Performance Targets (MVP)

- **Latency**: Responses under 2 seconds for single-step commands
- **Breadth**: Handles 3+ command types minimum
- **Reliability**: Consistent and accurate execution
- **UX**: Natural interaction with visible, immediate feedback

---

## Technical Implementation

### Tool Schema Definition

The AI agent will call these canvas API functions:

```typescript
// Core shape operations
createRectangle(x: number, y: number, width: number, height: number, color: string): string // returns shapeId

changeColor(shapeId: string, color: string): void

moveRectangle(shapeId: string, x: number, y: number): void

resizeRectangle(shapeId: string, width: number, height: number): void

deleteRectangle(shapeId: string): void

// Context retrieval
getCanvasState(): CanvasState // returns current rectangles with their properties (id, x, y, width, height, color)

getViewportInfo(): ViewportInfo // returns current zoom level and pan position
```

### AI Agent Architecture

**Components:**

1. **AI Service Layer** (`/src/services/aiAgent.ts`)
   - Handles communication with chosen AI SDK
   - Parses user natural language input
   - Manages function calling flow
   - Returns structured commands to execute

2. **Canvas Command Executor** (`/src/services/canvasCommandExecutor.ts`)
   - Receives structured commands from AI Service
   - Translates commands to Konva.js operations
   - Broadcasts changes to Firebase Realtime Database
   - Handles error states and validation

3. **AI Chat Interface Component** (`/src/components/AIChat.tsx`)
   - Text input for user commands
   - Displays AI responses and execution status
   - Shows loading states during processing
   - Handles multi-user AI command queue

This MVP scope focuses on the core functionality with simpler command types and removes the complexity of multi-step operations. Would you like me to expand on any of these sections or add implementation details?
