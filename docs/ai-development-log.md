## Key Learnings About Working with AI Coding Agents

Working with an AI coding agent proved most effective when treating it as a senior developer who needs clear context and specific direction. The AI excels at systematic implementation but requires human oversight for architectural decisions and quality control. Three critical learnings emerged:

**Context is Everything**: The AI performs best when given comprehensive background through PRDs, clear requirements, and access to existing codebase. Starting each major phase with "Read this PRD carefully and let me know if you have any questions" established a strong foundation.

**Quality Control is Essential**: While the AI can generate functional code rapidly, human review is crucial. The refactor session revealed bloat and anti-patterns that accumulated during fast development - the AI needed explicit instruction to "check for bloat or anything that's not best practices."

**Iterative Refinement Works**: Breaking development into discrete PRs (1-9) with specific goals allowed for controlled progress. When the AI misunderstood requirements (like implementing movement when resizing was needed), course correction was straightforward with specific feedback.

## AI Strengths and Limitations Observed

### Strengths:
- **Rapid Implementation**: Generated complete React/TypeScript components with Firebase integration efficiently
- **Pattern Recognition**: Consistently applied established patterns across the codebase (contexts, services, hooks)
- **Technical Problem Solving**: Successfully debugged complex issues like React-Konva compatibility and event handling conflicts
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Created thorough unit tests with proper mocking and edge case coverage
- **Documentation**: Maintained detailed task lists, progress tracking, and technical decisions

### Limitations:
- **Architecture Bloat**: Created overly complex components (415-line Canvas.tsx) without prompting to consider separation of concerns
- **Code Quality Drift**: Accumulated technical debt and redundant patterns without self-correction
- **Requirement Interpretation**: Sometimes focused on literal task completion rather than understanding user intent (implementing movement vs. resizing)
- **Context Loss**: Needed reminders about previous decisions and established patterns across long sessions

## Effective Prompting Strategies

### 1. **Specification-First Prompting**
*"Read this PRD carefully and let me know if you have any questions"*

Starting with comprehensive documentation review created alignment. Following up with specific clarifications ("Let's use Firebase Anonymous Auth", "throttle cursor updates every 16ms") eliminated ambiguity upfront.

### 2. **Corrective Feedback Prompting**
*"You're right that rectangle movement is implemented. The missing functionality is rectangle resizing"*

When the AI misunderstood requirements, specific corrections with concrete examples proved more effective than general guidance. Pointing out exactly what was wrong and what was needed redirected effort efficiently.

### 3. **Quality Audit Prompting**
*"Check each file for bloat or anything that's not best practices... Focus on files greater than 300 lines"*

Explicit quality control requests with specific criteria (line count, best practices) surfaced issues that weren't caught during development. The AI needed permission to critique its own work.

### 4. **Systematic Task Prompting**
*"Please implement the tasks for PR 7"*

Referring to predefined task lists maintained focus and ensured completeness. When combined with todo tracking, this created clear accountability for deliverables.

### 5. **Direct Problem-Solution Prompting**
*"For the code present, we get this error: Cannot find name 'vi'. How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise"*

When encountering specific technical issues, providing exact error messages with requests for concise solutions generated targeted fixes without unnecessary explanation.

The most successful pattern was establishing clear requirements upfront, maintaining systematic task tracking, providing specific feedback when course correction was needed, and explicitly requesting quality audits at logical checkpoints. This approach leveraged the AI's implementation speed while maintaining human control over architecture and quality standards.
